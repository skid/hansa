# Hansa Teutonica online

## Run it

- Just clone and `yarn` and `yarn dev`
- Play with your console open
- Obviously stuff are missing (like most of the map and the marker mechanic)

## Frontend

- State managed with immer.js
- Game logic runs entirely on frontend
- Graphics done with simple React SVG

## Backend

- The backend is handled by supabase.
- When you create a game, you get a UUID (the game's id). Use this URL (`hansa-teutonica.com/games/<game-uuid>`) to get the invite links for each player. If you forget the game's ID, it's lost - create a new one.
- Each player gets a unique link to the game `hansa-teutonica.com/play/<player-uuid>`.
- A game is directly created from the React frontend. You get a redirect to the game details page, and you can share links to other players.
- Other players load the game via their unique player link.
- Their moves overwrite the game state, so they can fuck up (or hack) the game for everyone. This is a dev server, not a final app.
- If supabase supports pub/sub, changes to the game state are pushed to all other users

## Contribute / Roadmap

Here's what we have:

- A functional game with all basic actions implemented
- Flow control / turn management
- A game map with 3 cities

What we need:

- Imeplement marker mechanics
  - Render markers (in the routes and he player UI)
  - Add actions and validators for each marker
  - Implement the "place marker" phase
- Finish the entire map and implement pan/zoom
  - Just add the cities and routes at the correct coordinates
  - Pan and zoom on the SVG element is useful too
- Implement an end-game condition and decide who won
